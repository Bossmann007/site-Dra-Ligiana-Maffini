## Development

When starting the dev server, use background mode:

```
astro dev --background
```

Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and `astro dev logs`.

## Learned User Preferences

- Portuguese OK for chat; keep code and identifiers in English
- Prefer `/poteto-mode` for non-trivial SiteLili engineering; keep diffs minimal
- Do not invent clinical claims, prices, reviews, or AI-generated clinic images — use only approved copy and real photo/video frames
- Do not deploy, change DNS, or edit Doctoralia without an explicit ask
- Do not add on-site search (Pagefind/Algolia) while the site stays around a dozen pages
- Clinic gallery frames must exclude patients, other people, documents, charts, screens, names, phones, or other personal data
- Medicina do Estilo de Vida is formação/abordagem, not a second announced specialty (doctor-confirmed). Portuguese is primary; teleconsulta may also be English, Italian, or German when available and clinically indicated. No /en /it /de pages. Do not invent YMYL footer sources or clinical review dates

## Learned Workspace Facts

- App code lives in `Projects/SiteLili/repo` (Astro 7 static, Cloudflare Pages, canonical `https://www.draligianamaffini.com.br`)
- `trailingSlash: 'always'`; shared helper `src/lib/paths.ts` `withTrailingSlash`
- NAP, CRM/RQE, specialty wording, and FAQs are centralized in `src/data/site.ts`; specialty landings in `src/data/specialties.ts`
- No patient forms — contact is WhatsApp/email only
- Home `homeGallery` mixes Dra. portraits with the three `clinic-photo-1..3.webp` waiting-room/clinic frames (see `src/data/photos.ts`)
- Quality gate: `npm run check:site` runs `astro check`, build, and `scripts/verify-dist.mjs`
- Outside the repo until fixed: apex `draligianamaffini.com.br` DNS → `www`; Doctoralia still contradicts Curitiba NAP / teleconsulta
